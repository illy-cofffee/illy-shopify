Our approach consists of analyzing and improving impacts throughout the coffee supply chain, conducting research in the field and sharing knowledge, as well as supporting integrated farming to preserve and improve the sustainable quality of the coffee. The second is linked to quality of life, pursued through the principles of economic, social, and environmental sustainability and by promoting global partnerships targeting this goal.
