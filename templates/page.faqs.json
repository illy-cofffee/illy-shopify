This method guarantees a longer preservation time, maintaining flavour and aroma for over 24 months. At the same time it 'ages' the coffee, improving its aroma over time by causing its volatile aroma compounds to bind with the oils that are contained in the beans. Simple vacuum packing cannot achieve this flavour transformation. The positive pressure exerted by <em>illy's </em>method actually forces these aroma compounds back into the coffee whereas vacuum packing lets them seep out. The effect of <em>illy's </em>aging process is similar in many ways to the development of complex flavours when a fine red wine is aged under proper conditions.</p>",

We work directly with nearly 900 growers on 4 continents to source sustainably grown coffee. Certified organic coffee accounts for approximately 4% of world production and we cannot guarantee that 100% of the 9 different Arabica varieties in our blend will be certified at all times. In addition, <em>illy caffè</em> tests the green coffee (before roasting) for up to 80 different chemicals to insure that our coffee is safe and pure.</p><p><em>illy's</em> demand for the highest quality beans is rarely met through organic coffee. Because <em>illy</em> is a single blend composed of beans from 7 to 9 growing regions, some organics may be present in the blend if they meet our rigid quality standards. Organic coffee has a very low yield per hectare-about 6 to 8 bags per hectare. This low yield is not compensated for by a proportionally higher price, so the farmer makes less, not more. Furthermore, and quite importantly, the cultivation of so-called organic coffee depletes the soil of its nutrients without sufficiently replacing them. Unless the farmer rigorously practices proper soil analysis and management and adds enough phosphorus (which coffee needs to grow well) the plants are weak and highly susceptible to insect and fungus attack. Few farmers maintain their soil at the high level necessary to produce the best beans. The process can lead to an irreversible deterioration in the quality of the soil. As part of our ISO 9001 certification we test every coffee lot we purchase for the presence of pesticide residue-testing for 36 different types. No coffee with pesticide residue is purchased by <em>illy</em>.</p>",

It is important to use these materials in order to ensure that the capsule can withstand high operating pressure during extraction. <em>illy </em>strives to maintain sustainable practices in everything we do and is a strong advocate of recycling waste products. While our capsule is made from recyclable material, we are currently working on a means by which consumers can open the capsule and clean it out in order for it to be recycled after use.
