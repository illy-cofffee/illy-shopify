This marked the birth of the illy Art Collection, which transformed an object of everyday use into a white canvas on which 125 artists of international fame, from great maestros to young talents, have tested their skills over the years. Thirty years later, the leading names in contemporary art continue to find inspiration in the white porcelain surface. Together, we have created a unique collection of small works of art in the shape of a cup.</p>"
